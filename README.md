# Solar Mapping
Assessing solar energy potential of building roofs, evaluating solar panel suitability and associated benefits
- Computed optimal path for volunteers to congregate at a convenient public location (park), travel to pertinent locations and return
- Trained GeoAI image analyst deep learning model to identify areas with high solar panel usage (number of buildings)
